            <li>2 tablespoons red miso</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons hot water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>4 skinless salmon fillets, 5 to 6 ounce pieces</li>
            <li>kosher salt, for seasoning</li>
            <li>black pepper, for seasoning</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sliced green onions</li>
            <li><small>1/2</small> teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Heat Oven -</strong> Set the oven rack to the lowest position. 
                Heat on the high broil setting. Line a large baking sheet with foil. 
                Lightly drizzle with olive oil to prevent sticking. Set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the Glaze -</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together brown 
                sugar, miso, hot water, and soy sauce. Set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Glaze the Salmon -</strong> Season both sides of the fillets with 
                salt and pepper. Arrange them at least 2 inches apart on the prepared 
                baking sheet. Spoon or brush about 1 tablespoons of miso glaze over 
                the surface and sides of each fillet. Reserve the remaining glaze.</li>
            <li><strong>Broil -</strong> Broil the salmon on the lowest rack for 5 minutes. 
                Remove and add more glaze to the surface. Broil for 3 minutes, 
                then glaze one more time. Broil until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 
                and reaches an internal temperature between 135 to 140ºF (57 to 60ºC) on an 
                instant-read thermometer, about 2 minutes depending on thickness.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve -</strong> Transfer to a serving platter or dish. 
                Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds.</li>
        </ol>
