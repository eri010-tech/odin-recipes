            <li>3 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>

            </li>
            <li>1 <small>1/2</small> tablespoons vegetable oil, melted coconut oil, 
                or melted butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>

                toppings</small></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place sugar, flour, cocoa powder and salt in a mug. Use a small 
                whisk or fork, and stir until combined, and free of lumps. Stir 
                in chocolate chips. Add oil, milk, and vanilla, stir with a spoon or 
                small rubber spatula until just combined 
                (try not to over mix it).</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a few additional chocolate chips over the top and cook 
                in the microwave for 60 seconds. Check to see if it is done 
                (no raw batter, fudgy chocolate chips are ok). 
                If necessary, continue cooking in 10 second increments. 
                Time will vary a bit based on the microwave and the size of mug. 
                Eat immediately with ice cream, whipped cream, powdered sugar, 
                or berries.</li>
        </ol>
